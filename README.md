# Yukari ðŸ’œ
(you can call it Dorpsgek F if you prefer)

Yukari is an xboard-protocol chess program. (there is presently no UCI support.)

## how strong is it?

- 2024.12.1: approximately 2800 CCRL

## thanks to:

in no particular order:
- @Lunaphied who wrote the xboard protocol code
- @87flowers for motivating me to pick up Yukari after three years
- @analog-hors for patiently debugging my transposition table code
- @dannyhammer for hosting and sharing the Toad OpenBench instance
- @Ciekce for guiding the NNUE implementation
- the Loftycord, for being amazing friends

sometimes you *can* teach an old wolf new tricks.
