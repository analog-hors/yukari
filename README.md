# Yukari ðŸ’œ
(you can call it Dorpsgek G if you prefer)

Yukari is a primarily xboard-protocol chess program.
(UCI support exists, but xboard should be preferred if your GUI isn't from the stone age.)

## how strong is it?

- 2025.2.4: approximately CCRL 3100
- 2024.12.1: 2825 CCRL 40/4; 2824 CCRL 40/40

## thanks to:

in no particular order:
- @Lunaphied who wrote the xboard protocol code
- @87flowers for motivating me to pick up Yukari after three years
- @analog-hors for patiently debugging my transposition table code
- @dannyhammer for hosting and sharing the Toad OpenBench instance
- @Ciekce for guiding the NNUE implementation
- @JonathanHallstrom for running Yukari datagen
- the Loftycord, for being amazing friends

sometimes you *can* teach an old wolf new tricks.
